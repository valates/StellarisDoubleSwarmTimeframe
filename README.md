# Installing this mod manually

Download the zip containing these files. You should get a folder name something like "blahblah-master." Inside that folder is a .mod file which can be opened with notepad and a folder containing other files. Copy and paste the .mod file and the folder to "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod." After that, this mod should show up as a selectable mod in your mod list on startup.

You don't need the README.md file.
